	<h4>A LETTER TO MYSELF</h4>
	<p>Hey! My guess is I’m sitting right in front of you right now, and you’re wondering why I don’t just talk to you. Well, the main reason is because I don’t want to mess this up. I’m afraid if we just talk, I’ll miss something and beat myself up on my way home for forgetting. I want to thank you for the things you’ve taught me.
	When we met, you were so wonderful; everything about you took my breath away. You were quirky and honest and full of life, I couldn’t help but be near you… by the end of that first night, we were holding hands, passed out on the floor behind the couch; I hope you remember that. It was the night I fell in love. Thank you for that. I will carry it with me always. Thank you also, for all the late night talks we had. There was always something about the way you listened that made me feel like the only person in the world. It wasn’t always bad between us. I want you to remember that. Thank you for introducing me to Tom and Jerry. It is my favorite cartoon because you were in my life. Thank you for taking an interest in learning about my culture. I remember your butchered Spanish sentences- but hey, you were trying. Thank you for missing me when I traveled. I always felt loved, even though you never said it.</p><br>
